# Engl105-Unit3
This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks covering basic topics in coding with Python3, and beginning modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis. 
These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the Research Hub of UNC's Davis Library. 
Providence: Where did this data come from/why did you choose this data
Purpose: what/who is it for
Potential: why was this created and what might people do with it
