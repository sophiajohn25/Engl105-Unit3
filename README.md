# Engl105-Unit3
This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL-105 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks:
1. Module on basic topics in coding with Python3
2. Module on getting started with the Pandas package 
3. Module on using the Pandas package for data analysis. 

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](https://library.unc.edu/data/) of UNC's Davis Library. 

This data is sourced from the [US Government Data Catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/number-of-cancer-surgeries-volume-performed-in-california-hospitals-6e092). It serves to quantify the different cancer-related surgeries that have been performed in the state of California. I chose this data set because I was interested in manipulating the data to examine the most common cancer-related surgeries and hone in on the specific counties where they occurred. 

This repository is intended for anyone who is interested in the patterns of cancer treatment between 2013-2020, as well as the data regarding the numeric differences in cases by county and cancer type. 

This repository was created in order to analyze smaller subsets of data within the greater dataset. In the future, it can be used to analyze different more variables including the other cancer types, as well as being broken down further into each hospital.
