# Analyzing Cancer Data by California Counties
This is a repository containing a folder with a smaller subset of data curated from a larger dataset, as well as python notebooks to document the processes of creating and reproducing the subset. 

This data is sourced from the [US Government Data Catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/number-of-cancer-surgeries-volume-performed-in-california-hospitals-6e092). It serves to quantify the different cancer-related surgeries that have been performed in the state of California. I chose this data set because I was interested in manipulating the data to examine the most common cancer-related surgeries and hone in on the specific counties where they occurred.

This repository is intended for anyone who is interested in the patterns of cancer treatment between 2013-2020, as well as the data regarding the numeric differences in cases by county and cancer type. Users can identify possible patterns in areas that surgeries were performed, as well as which type of cancer was treated. 

This repository was created in order to analyze smaller subsets of data within the greater dataset. In the future, it can be used to analyze different more variables including the other cancer types, as well as being broken down further into each hospital. A user hoping to analyze this data further would be able to both reproduce the given subset, as well as create their own by working with different variables of the dataset. 

## Data Visualization

This repository also consists of a Data Visualization folder containing two different displays of data visualization using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

The first data visualization features a bubble chart to demonstrate the frequency of each surgery based on cancer type. This chart allows users to easily identify, based on bubble size, the most and least common surgeries performed for each type of cancer in Orange County. These findings could potentially lead to deeper study of the causes behind the varying levels of prevalence for each cancer type. 

![Orange_Subset Visualization 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118300502/202928202-07ea499a-5b21-4ff0-a7f2-e1f7c4cee05a.jpg)

The second data visualization quantifies the amount of cases appearing in each hospital in Orange County. Government or public health officials could potentially use the data to analyze hospitals with the greatest amount of surgeries performed, guiding allocation of resources and funding.
